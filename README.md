# Cleanify

## What does Cleanify do?

Cleanify is a free software built to help MacOS&reg; users to keep their computer clean, saving disk memory. <br>
Many applications create temporarily files to cache data, save information and store intermediate states of the application itself. These files are often not deleted after use, taking up unnecessary disk space. <br>
When we delete an app directly from ```Application``` folder, we are deleting its executable file, not its cache file. <br>
Here is where ```Cleanify``` comes to help us!
